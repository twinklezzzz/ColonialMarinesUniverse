cmu-transmissions-title = Secure Transmissions
cmu-transmissions-heading = Cipher Key Recovery

cmu-transmissions-tiers-section = Intercept a transmission
cmu-transmissions-tier = {$name}: {$length} symbols from {$symbols}, {$attempts} attempts (up to ${$reward})
cmu-transmissions-tier-commercial = Commercial

cmu-transmissions-clear = Clear
cmu-transmissions-submit = Try key
cmu-transmissions-status-active = {$name} transmission. {$left} {$left ->
    [one] attempt
   *[other] attempts
} left.
cmu-transmissions-status-solved = Key recovered in {$attempts} {$attempts ->
    [one] attempt
   *[other] attempts
}. Paid ${$payout} to the corporate budget.
cmu-transmissions-status-failed = Out of attempts. The key was {$key}.
cmu-transmissions-status-cooldown = Next transmission in {$seconds}s.
